zsurf - simple QtWebKit1 browser. 

This browser is intended primarily for use on systems with limited memory. ZSurf uses QtWebKit1 which includes recent security patches from Apple and is also single threaded which greatly reduces memory usage.

The browser currently includes a simple script which offers Vim key bindings and simple hits. Future versions will offer a variety of scripts.

No AdBlock:
Future versions will offer a JavaScript based AdBlocker. I recommend using Privoxy with EasyList for the time being.

Build/Install Instructions:

qmake

make

sudo make install
